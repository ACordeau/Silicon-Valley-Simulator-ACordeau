# Silicon-Valley-Simulator-ACordeau

The first design pattern I used is the Facotry Pattern for determining Startups and TechGiants at runtime. You can find in the Startup and TechGiants package a factory for each.

The second pattern used is the Decorator Pattern which you can find implemented inside of the Startup.java class. The actual decorated classes are found in the Evolutions package.

The final pattern used is the State Pattern, the states change inside of the Gameplay.java class in the Gameplay package, and the states themselves are implemented in the Quarters package.
